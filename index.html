		  <h6>About</h6>
		<p>I am a post doctoral researcher in the Experimental Solid State Physics group at Imperial College London, where I research hot-carrier solar cells, thermodynamics of solar energy conversion and spectral modification with luminescent materials.</p> 

		  <!--I am in the final stages of completing my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Keith Barnham on the 'Characterisation, modelling and development of Luminescent Solar Concentrators'. I will continue to work on Luminescent Concentrators and Quantum Dots in the group at Imperial College over the coming months.--> <!--I have completed extensive experimental and computational work on wave-guide structures and am currently investigating optical thin-films.   I other areas I have advised a large multinational on commercialisation of a building integrate photovoltaic product. -->
		  <!--Photovoltaics (PV) is the science of electrical power generation by the direct conversion of solar energy. In our research group we are looking a new material and have pioneered the use of nano-structures to make solar energy cheaper.!-->

				<h5>Hot-carrier solar cell</h5>
				<!--<p>When sunlight is absorbed by a solar cell, the energy distribution of electrons promoted to the conduction band (and also holes in the valence band) is coherent with the incident spectrum. However, the coherency is rapidly lost (on the scale of femtoseconds) as electron-electron scattering brings the carriers into a thermal distribution with each other. This is known as the hot-carrier phase, because the characteristic temperature is much hotter than the lattice temperature. The electrons are in thermal equilibrium with each other but are not in thermal equilibrium with the lattice. The hot-carrier will steadily cool (in the order of picoseconds) to a thermal distribution characterised by the lattice temperature and a non-zero quasi-fermi level.</p>-->

<p>Within the framework of the hot-carrier solar cell, thermalisation losses are eliminated by forbidding interactions between charge carriers and the lattice. Energy that would otherwise be lost is stored in the carrier population as heat. Provided that the carriers are thermally isolated from the lattice they may attain a temperature intermediate between that of the Sun and the ambient, and extra energy can be extracted because entropy generation is suppressed.</p>

				<h5>Luminescent concentrators</h5>

				<p>The luminescent concentrator is a non-tracking approach to the concentration of solar energy. One very important feature of the luminescent concentrator is that it collects diffuse light as well as direct. This is significant, especially for high latitudes where the diffuse can account for 60% of the total insolation. The luminescent concentrator aims to reduced the cost-per-watt of generated power. This is achieved by the geometric and photon concentration factors between the top and edge surfaces.</p>
				
				<h5>Quantum Dots</h5>
				<p>Quantum dots are nanoscale crystals of semiconductor materials. One interesting feature of quantum dots is that their optical properties are size dependent. This is because of <em>quantum confinement</em> of the electron and hole wavefunctions. Our group has proposed replacing organic dyes with quantum dots in luminescent concentrators. This has several advantages; emission colour can be changed by changing the particle size, large red-shifts can be produced by controlling the spread in dot sizes and quantum dots should be inherently more stable than organic materials.</p>

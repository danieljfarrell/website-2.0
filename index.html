                Conventional solar cell are now, after many decades of research and development, beginning to approach their fundamental limits. These devices harvest <em>solar photons</em> and directly convert them to electrical current.</p>

                <p class="pcaption">Fundamental losses in solar cells: thermalisation loss and below bandgap loss.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>A spectrum of photons enter conventional solar cells: blue and UV photons possess high energy and red and infrared photons possess less energy. A semiconductor has an energy threshold that called the <em>bandgap</em> that is the minimum energy a photon needs to be absorbed. If a photon has less energy it will remain unabsorbed; from the perspective of the photon the material looks transparent. This is called <em>below bandgap loss</em>.</p>
                
                <p>
                 When electrons exit a solar cell they all eave with the same amount of energy (set by the voltage of device). However, light that generated these electrons has a large range of energies, thus during the conversion process energy has been lost. This is known as <em>thermalisation loss</em>. In conventional solar cells the energy of above bandgap photons is not utilised, it simply wasted as lattice vibrations (heat).</p>
                 
                 <div>
                <img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chxs=0,676767,16&chxt=x&chs=410x150&cht=p3&chco=B4C7AB|C2CEE4|9B8A9D|3366CC&chd=s:TVV&chdl=Power|Thermalisation|Unabsorbed&chl=31%25|34%25|35%25" width="410" height="150" alt="" />
                <p class="pcaption">Where does the energy go?</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>In today's best solar cells the power extracted is less than 1/3 of the solar power that was incident. The pie chart show how the absorbed energy divides up into useful power generation, and the losses processes.</p>
                <p>
                The challenge for future research is to better harness the energy content of each photon. Moreover, rather than just capturing solar photons in a one-to-one conversion process we must address how the <em>solar energy</em> carried by each photon can be utilised to the fullest potential.</p>
                
                <h3>Hot-carrier solar cells</h3>
                
                <p>The hot-carrier solar cell is one of the most ambitious attempts at making the ultimate photovoltaic converter. It has the potential to eliminate both thermalisation and below bandgap losses. In this concept, thermalisation losses are eliminated using a mechanism prevents charge carriers from interacting with the lattice. Energy that would otherwise transfer to the lattice is stored in the carrier population as heat. In theory this enables very high conversion efficiencies because a low bandgap material can be chosen to maximise absorption across the spectrum, and still achieve high efficiency.</p>
                
                <h5>Luminescent solar concentrators</h5>
                
                                <p>As well as being efficiency, the other factor driving photovoltaic research is the reduction of costs. High efficiency approaches are best suited to large power-plant installation. What is important for the average consumer or small business wishing to install solar panels is the <em>cost-per-Watt</em> of the technology: how much power power is generated for the amount of money spent.</p>
                                
                <img src="img/lsc.jpg" class="top push-0 shadow" alt="Luminescent solar concentrators">

                <p>Luminescent solar concentrators.</p></div>
                
                <p>The luminescent concentrator is a non-tracking approach to the concentration of solar energy. One very important feature of the luminescent concentrator is that it collects diffuse light as well as direct. This is significant, especially for high latitudes where the diffuse can account for 60% of the total insolation. The luminescent concentrator aims to reduced the cost-per-watt of generated power. This is achieved by the geometric and photon concentration factors between the top and edge surfaces.</p>
                
                <h5>Quantum Dots</h5>
                <p>Quantum dots are nanoscale crystals of semiconductor materials. One interesting feature of quantum dots is that their optical properties are size dependent. This is because of <em>quantum confinement</em> of the electron and hole wavefunctions. Our group has proposed replacing organic dyes with quantum dots in luminescent concentrators. This has several advantages; emission colour can be changed by changing the particle size, large red-shifts can be produced by controlling the spread in dot sizes and quantum dots should be inherently more stable than organic materials.</p>

Present building integrated photovoltaics: Silicon modules Thin-film facades The next generation... “Smart windows” Direct system Direct + Diffuse system Light-bars Acronyms: Photovoltaics = PV Building Integrated PV = BIPV   A photovoltaic cell (a.k.a solar cell) behaves like a battery But only gives out power when light hits it Particles of light are called photons What is photovoltaics?      Why Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV)? Motivation: Local generation of power when demand is high In the UK 7x the solar energy falls on commercial building than is used inside K.Barnham et al. Nature Materials 5, 161 - 164 (2006) doi:10.1038/nmat1604 We are treating the solar energy as a problem, but it’s a solution! Blinds to blocklight still require air-con. and lighting.  What is photovoltaics?- Efficiency The performance of solar cell is its efficiency efficiency = power out / power in For example: A 1m2 solar cell has... 1000 Watts of solar power incident Produces 200 Watts of electrical power Efficiency = 20% Solar power in Electrical power out   What is photovoltaics?- Cost High efficiency must be affordable! Another way of saying this is: What is the cost per Watt of the generated electricity? The cost per Watt should be minimised Current fossil fuel technology can generated electrical power at $1/W Where is photovoltaics in this respect? “This is the world's lowest-cost solar panel, which we believe will make us the first solar manufacturer capable of profitably selling solar panels at as little as 99 cents a watt.” -- Nanosolar, 2008  3 generations of photovoltaics           0 100 200 300 400 500 20 40 60 80 100 Efficiency (%) Cost in US$ for a 1m2 solar module      US$0.10/W US$0.20/W US$0.50/W US$1.00/W US$3.50/W Adapted from original by M.Green,  UNSW.

Conventional silicon PV (Wafer based c-Si) 2. Conventional thin-film PV (a-Si, CdTe)  2nd  3rd generation PV is a ‘concentrator technology’ 3rd generation PV uses:  high efficiency materials (e.g. GaAs). very small areas of cell, ~1mm2 very large area of lens and mirror. The lens and mirror used concentrate the sun between 100--1000 times.  Concentrator PV farm - SolFocus  How can we use 3rd generation PV in buildings? Roof installations: Provide electricity and hot water to the building. 15% efficient PV conversion 45% efficient hot water generation John F.H. Smeltink and Andrew W. Blakers The next generation of BIPV  Smart Windows - “Solar Skin from Solar Structure” Smart Windows: Keith Barnham, 2006.     Smart Windows Smart Windows: Direct light absorbed Diffuse enters room Lower demand on  air-conditioning Provides heat and electricity  Advantages of the Smart Window concept The direct light is total absorbed in the solar cells: Does not cause interior heating Reduces air-conditioning loads AND produces electricity AND produces hot-water Diffuse light illuminates the room No glare Just diffuse blue sky and white light  How does the smart window compare to 2nd generation building integrated PV? Diffuse 2nd Generation  thin-silicon windows 3rd Generation  smart windows      Direct  21% Electricity Interior illumination 35% 5%  5%  12% Electricity 65% Heat dispersion  22% Heating 78% 65% 22%   It’s not sunny all the time... In the UK approx. 50% of the yearly solar energy arrives as diffuse light. Smart Window can still generate significant amount of power Can we design and building integrated system to harvest the diffuse component...?  Blue sky and clouds.   Luminescent solar concentrators Diffuse Direct  Solar cells placed on edges Advantages for BIPV: Concentrates direct and diffuse illumination Interesting colours Interesting shapes Depending on colour and size, 5% efficiency. Non-tracking Freedom to design   Luminescent materials in BIPV  Luminescent materials in BIPV Mauro Pravettoni  Can select shape and colour 5% efficiency Useful for decoration Facades Windows.....? Luminescent materials in BIPV  Transparent luminescent materials Tinted windows work well for facades and decoration Windows should remain transparent Absorb invisible wavelengths of light: Ultra-violet (UV) and Infrared (IR). Currently only UV absorbing luminescent materials exist.

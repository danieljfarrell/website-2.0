   <h3>Research interests</h3>
                
                <h5>Hot-carrier solar cell</h5>
                
                <p>The hot-carrier solar cell is one of the most ambitious attempts at making the ultimate photovoltaic converter. It has the potential to eliminate both thermalisation and below bandgap losses. In this concept, thermalisation losses are eliminated using a mechanism prevents charge carriers from interacting with the lattice. Energy that would otherwise transfer to the lattice is stored in the carrier population as heat. In theory this enables very high conversion efficiencies because a low bandgap material can be chosen to maximise absorption across the spectrum, and still achieve high efficiency.</p>
                
                <h5>Luminescent solar concentrators</h5>
                
                                <p>As well as being efficiency, the other factor driving photovoltaic research is the reduction of costs. High efficiency approaches are best suited to large power-plant installation. What is important for the average consumer or small business wishing to install solar panels is the <em>cost-per-Watt</em> of the technology: how much power power is generated for the amount of money spent.</p>

                
                <p>The luminescent concentrator is a non-tracking approach to the concentration of solar energy. One very important feature of the luminescent concentrator is that it collects diffuse light as well as direct. This is significant, especially for high latitudes where the diffuse can account for 60% of the total insolation. The luminescent concentrator aims to reduced the cost-per-watt of generated power. This is achieved by the geometric and photon concentration factors between the top and edge surfaces.</p>
